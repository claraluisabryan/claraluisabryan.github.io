      <b>
      My name is Luisa Bryan and I am from Chicago.
      I am a Computer Science Major, Integrative Digital Design Minor,
      and Critical Theory Double Minor at Wesleyan University.
      <br> <br> I enjoy programming, making digital and computational media, and making music.
      <br> <br> I have a working knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, and Illustrator, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, Unity, Rhino and Grashopper, Ableton, and Max for Live.
      <br> <br> For fun, I like to design and laser cut earrings, I like to play and produce music / synthesize sounds with friends, and I like to bike.
      <br> <br> Thank you for visiting my virtual portfolio :)
