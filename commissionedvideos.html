            "A Body in Fukushima is a film created by Eiko Otake to be screened either with or without a photo exhibition and/or Eiko's live performance. The film was crafted from hundreds of photographs, taken by William Johnston, of Eiko Otake in the surreal, irradiated landscapes of post-nuclear meltdown Fukushima, Japan."

            I was involved with this body of work as a video editor. The first work I edited for Eiko is A Body in Places: Met Edition,
            which was a 7.5 hour long video projection and dance performance piece commissioned by Metropolitan Museum's Live Arts.
            This work was showcased at the Met Cloisters, the Met Breuer, and 
            the Met Fifth Avenue. I later assisted with the editing of
            other iterations of this project in preparation for 
            showcases in Taipei, Taiwan.

            accumulate the necessary sound technology, to help
