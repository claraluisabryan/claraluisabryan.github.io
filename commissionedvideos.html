            Tiny shed is a student run DIY venue that hosts live studio recordings
            in a shed at Wesleyan University. My role as one of the organizers
            is to help reach out to performers, to coordinate with the 
            musicians, the sound gear co-operative, and the sound engineer to
            accumulate the necessary sound technology, to help
            with the sound recording process, and to edit together the 
            final video of the studio recording session.

            The video above is a Tiny Shed studio recording featuring the band Lake Ontario Surfing Club.
