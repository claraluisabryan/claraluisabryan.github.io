            Tiny shed is a student run DIY venue that hosts live studio recordings
            in a shed at Wesleyan University. My role as one of the organizers
            is to help reach out to performers, to coordinate with the 
            musicians, the sound gear co-operative, and the sound engineer to
            accumulate the necessary sound technology, to help
            with the sound recording process, and to edit together the 
            final video of the studio recording session.
