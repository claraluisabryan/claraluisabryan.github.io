        I have made. <br> I like combining different tools and platforms for digital art making in

       The above GIFS and images were created on Photoshop. <br>

     Works Projects Administration (WPA) posters.
     <br> The still image of the cloud monster water cycle was screenprinted
     onto various shirts and tote bags.

       The video and images above were programmed in Processing and edited in Adobe Premiere.
       <br> I wrote object oriented code in Processing to make an interactive
       drawing tool. <br> I used that drawing tool to make a looping
       video in support of Internet.Hotspot, a Chicago entertainment company.

       These two images were generated in Processing. They are screenshots of
       interactive remakes of
       Josef Albers' color theory work.
       When the viewer presses different keys,
       the image changes and different frequency sin oscillators are generated.

       The two images above were generated and rendered with Unity and Grashopper.

       Cathedral, located in the Ukrainian Village, Chicago, where I grew up.
